Refactor it to use the rest operator & an arrow function:
```javascript
const filterOutOdds = (...args) => args.filter(num => num % 2 === 0)
```
**findMin**</br>
Write a function called findMin that accepts a variable number of arguments and returns the smallest argument. Make sure to do this using the rest and spread operator.
```javascript
const findMin = (...args) => Math.min(...args)
```
**mergeObjects**</br>
Write a function called **mergeObjects** that accepts two objects and returns a new object which contains all the keys and values of the first object and second object.
```javascript
const findMin = (...args) => Math.min(...args)
```
